//TODO - potential automated unit tests maybe for like jenkins or smoething
//passwords match in authentication
//check the various test cases in the create user form like checking if an object is returned, or if syntax is correct when getting a username, database returns a user
//profile throws an error if you try to put a letter in the database query that checks for an id
//maybe possible to unit test a view?  profile.ejs has logic checking if a user is logged in or if a user is the currently viewed profile
//test logic that checks if user is logged in in general

<!--
later - add to read db - probably a cleaner way to do this part other than throwing random exceptions.   look into it.

<!--
feed functionality
tags - maybe need to add it when user actually posts, and then have way to add it after - done but not auto tested

search tags
    -make sure it is still possible to add and remove tags and all that - done but not auto tested

<!--
    bug -done? spaces between lines of letters in reading post

      

later - in relation to tabs filters and sorts
  TODO - feedSort and feedFilter need testing and error handling

<!---->

bugs - potentially not parsing valid emails, but can't replicate rn.  will need more testing if more extensive, but works 99 percent of the time

//reada page
  //<div>Icons made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a></div>


    //post not bolding - fixed
//if on later page then search, says that page in url even search should begin on page 1.  will need to look into search results that have multiple pages - done, need test



//only sending 1 email-fixed

//frontend bugs
//error when clicking bookmark when not logged in.  just redirect to error page for now, but says post not found even though should be acct not logged in??
  //works fine when doing it from profile (subscribe and unsubscribe from user) - low
//cant rerender comment with error.  currently just redirecting to page with empty comment - low
//file too large error page addition/change - create error page
  -todo - add a page that says bookmarked already error
//create an error handling page (example 404 page, please try again.) - need test
  //edit post when wrong user redirects without using bookmark causing an error - neet test(i think this is an error page?)



//backend bugs
//image upload weird when uploading long image
//sometimes imge upload crashes system
//scheduler not really working
//can subscribe multiple times to 1 user




    //automated testing fixes, feature testing, cleanup and error pages (remove console.logs unless needed), deploy
        //look up app.close error tcpserverwrap jest when you start working on deploy
        //add link to profile - done, need test
      //update emailer to email every hour, but only email if timezone preference is currently aligned - x
      //map - convert timezone name to an integer, store that int to db.  Counter running, select query will be 'when tz = counter'. x




//list of stretch goals
//known issues emailer
//html taken literally aka it'll break lines halfway through the page bc thats what the html says - stretch
//attachments, pictures, links not working - stretch
//authResetEmail getNewToken doesn't call function. - strecth

  //email sending ** for bold - stretch, not working bc simpleparser textAsHtml vs HTML.
  //search/sort posts by user (profile page) - stretch, requires refactoring
  //back end update timezones on register - change to selector stretch, not sure why its not working

//stretch - add function that adds "Last month today/last year today/ last week today type message to send emails."
<!--edit post
    stretch: referrer so that you can only get to write from the edit button.
    stretch: edit button location
    later: edit quill toolbaar
-->
<!--post comment
later: styling for comments and post page in general
stretch: reply to comments
-->
stretch feed - add 'posts not found'
later - search
  -stretch is full text search

allow superuser to edit comments - feature is stretch
  -stretch is have page numbers.  difficult bc i dont know how many pages ill have/how to template it.

<!--technical debt
styling - maybe try to put it into style sheets
unit testing - maybe figure out how to do that + automated testing
